      <h1 class="ed-matt-title">Edward & Mattie Berry</h1>
      <p class="ed-matt-description" style=" font-family: Sintony, sans-serif">Edward Berry was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1954. When he was two-years-old, his family moved to Albany. His father passed away in 1870, which led to him leaving high school in order to help his family. When he was 16, he would walk 10 miles each day to work in Athens and earned 50 cents a day. A few years later he was promoted to be an errands boy in Parkersburg, West Virginia. He eventually saved up enough money to move to Athens where he started working as a caterer. In 1878, he married Martha (Mattie) Madry who was a girl he went to school with. That same year, he and his brother opened their own restaurant called “Berry Brothers” which eventually became the Berry Hotel.
